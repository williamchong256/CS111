Contents of lab1a-205114665.tar.gz:

lab1a.c:
	The source file used to compile the lab1a executable.
	Program behavior:
		Without passing in the --shell=program argument, the program changes the console to character-at-a-time, no-echo mode. 
		Keyboard input is echoed to stdout one char at a time, and is read one character at a time.

		Passing in the [--shell=program] optional argument; the program forks a process and executes the inputted program.
		It then passes keyboard input to the screen and created process program. It also passes the output of the shell/program 
		back to the screen. The program is terminated by EOF by the executed program, or by ^D or ^C input from keyboard.
		Uses pollfd structures to monitor which pipe to read from and write to.


Makefile:
	To compile and perform actions on the lab1a.c source file. Targets:

	- default: Compiles the lab1a executable from the lab1a.c source file with the '-g', '-Wall', and '-Wextra' options for debugging

	- dist: builds the tarball for distribution, includes lab1a.c, Makefile, and README files.

	- clean: delete all the files created by Makefile and return to untarred state

README:
	This file, which describes the contents of each file.
