-----------------------------------

lab4c_tcp.c: C source file for lab4c_tcp executable. 
	This program communicates with a server via TCP and generates timestamped 
	temperature sensor reports. It optionally outputs the reports and input
	commands to a specified --log=logfile. Commands that can be read during
	runtime are START, STOP, SCALE=F/C, PERIOD=seconds, OFF. 

lab4c_tls.c: C source file for lab4c_tls executable.
	This program communicates with a server via TCP and SSL to protect
	communication from attack. It also generates timestamped temperature
	reports and processes commands in the same way that lab4c_tcp does.

Makefile: Makefile to compile and build targets.

	default: compiles lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls executables from 
	  lab4c_tcp.c and lab4c_tls.c, respectively. Links -lm -lmraa -lssl
	  -lcrypto and -std=c99. Builds with -g, -Wall, -Wextra flags. 
	
	clean: restores to default, untarred state.

	dist: builds tarball for distribution with lab4c_tcp.c lab4c_tls.c
	  Makefile, README.
